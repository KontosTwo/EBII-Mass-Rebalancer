A mass rebalancer to solve the problem of standardizing infantry mass.

To run, type "java -jar <JAR_NAME> <ABSOLUTE_INPUT_PATH> <ABSOLUTE_OUTPUT_PATH>"
For example, "java -jar massrebalancer.jar /Users/export_descr_unit.txt /Users/export_descr_unit_balanced.txt

This application is written in a way that uses Java Enums to facilitate the
command pattern (https://www.baeldung.com/java-command-pattern), where each member
of each enum encapsulates all the data needed to run the mass rebalancer.
To add new behavior, simply add a new enum member to the Java Enum. The following
files follow this pattern:

 - UnitAttributeMapper.java: converts edu data to a format understandable to this program
 - UnitAttribute.java: defines each edu attribute and its program-understandable equivalent
 - BalancerDefinition.java: calculates edu mass based on the created Unit.java object
